* For my project, I developed an Interactive Quiz Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this application is to create a fun and educational platform that allows users to test their knowledge through multiple-choice questions. I structured the basic layout of the application using HTML, which includes a quiz container, a dynamic question section, clickable options, feedback messages, a score tracker, and a next button to load upcoming questions.

The design and visual styling were handled using CSS, which helped make the user interface clean, responsive, and engaging. I styled the quiz container with borders, padding, and background colors to enhance readability. I also included hover and active states for buttons to provide a better user experience and added styles for feedback messages—green for correct and red for incorrect answers—to provide immediate and intuitive feedback.

The core logic of the quiz is implemented in JavaScript, where I used arrays to store the questions, options, and correct answers. The script dynamically loads each question and generates the corresponding options as buttons. When a user selects an option, JavaScript checks if the answer is correct, updates the score, and displays feedback. The "Next Question" button allows the user to move to the next question until the quiz is complete.

This project helped me understand the practical integration of frontend technologies and how to handle user interactions dynamically. It strengthened my JavaScript skills, especially in DOM manipulation and event handling. Overall, this quiz application is a great example of how simple web technologies can be used to build an interactive and educational tool.*
